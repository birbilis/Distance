 This program helps you find quickly the distance (in km) between two cities of 
mainland Greece and by providing it with an average speed it calculates the 
time it will take you to travel that distance on the road.

The road distances came from HELLENIC POLICE calendar of 1991
and are not accurate anymore (this may be fixed in some future version).

 When you load the program you'll find a table with the major cities of mainland 
Greece. Choose two cities and once you're supplied with the distance between 
them, provide an average speed in km/hour. The program will return the time in 
which you'll cover that distance.

 The movement of the bright bar is done with the cursor keys and selection is 
 done with ENTER. To exit press F1 at any time. 
Function keys are displayed at the bottom row of the screen.

NOTICE: DISTANCE.EXE (DISTANCE.BAS), DISTANCE.DAT and CITIES.DAT must be located 
in the same folder.
